# Empirical Work From "Econometrics I" Class

This is the repository associated with the empirical work required at the class Econometrics I, from FGV-EESP's masters in Economics course. The file with the report is [main.pdf](main.pdf).

The task is described at [Empirical_Work.pdf](Empirical_Work.pdf), but basically entails the replication of works in the literature of “quantity-quality trade-off”, a la Becker and Lewis (1973) and Becker and Tomes (1976).

The data lives in [Data/](Data/), the main script is [main.R](main.R), and the actual report is built with [main.tex](main.R).
